Happy, Pappy?
===

Alors Simone, heureuse ? [fr] 

The original meaning in French appears sexually connotated
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alors,_heureuse_%3F
however, the expression has drifted towards a more general meaning of "so, did you get what you wanted?". The only English equivalent I know of is Happy, Pappy? [en]
