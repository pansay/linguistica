Happy, Pappy?
===

Alors Simone, heureuse ? [fr] 

The original meaning in French appears sexually connotated
http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alors,_heureuse_%3F
however, the expression has drifted towards a more general meaning of "so, did you get what you wanted?". The only English equivalent I know of is Happy, Pappy? [en]

George: All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
Jerry: Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?
George: Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
