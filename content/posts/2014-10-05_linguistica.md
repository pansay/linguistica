Lingüística
===

Lingüística is a blog about words, concepts, languages, linguistics.

Why the name? Because:

* lingüística [es];
* linguistica [la].

## Format

The usual format will most likely be akin to a "word of the day" style daily posting. But it will more likely be a *concept* of the day: what's most fascinating about language differences is the existence of words for a given abstract concept in one language, but not another.

## Conventions

I shall write the language of particular words using their [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), e.g. : lingüística [es], linguistica [la].
