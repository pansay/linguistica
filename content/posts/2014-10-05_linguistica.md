Lingüística
===

*Lingüística dot rocks* is a blog about words, concepts, languages, linguistics, culture and cultures.

Why lingüística? Because:

* *lingüística* [es];
* *linguistica* [la];
* *linguistica* [it];
* *linguística* [pt].

And yes, I'm *partial* [en] to the Spanish word, because it has all those cool accents. And it's not even an [hyperforeignism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforeignism)!

Why "rocks"?

Because learning language is as good as sex, [so says the science](http://rt.com/news/199416-brain-sex-chocolate-language/)!

## Format

The usual format will most likely be akin to a "word of the day" style daily posting. But it will more likely be a *concept* of the day: what's most fascinating about language differences is the existence of words for a given abstract concept in one language, but not another. Words-concepts, as I shall call them, or, more pedantically, *[lexicalized concepts](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/lexicalized+concept)*.

## Conventions

- I shall write the language of particular words using their [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), e.g. : *lingüística* [es], *linguistica* [la]. Even when writing English words, I'll use this format to annotate all language specific word-concepts (words, expressions, concepts, whose translation might not be straightforward), such as *course of action* [en].

 Later, I might use this annotation to allow searching the blog by language and by word-concept-expression.

- I'll use the ISO 8601 format for dates.
