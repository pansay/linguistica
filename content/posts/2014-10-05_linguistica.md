Lingüística
===

*Lingüística* is a blog about words, concepts, languages, linguistics.

Why the name? Because:

* *lingüística* [es];
* *linguistica* [la];
* *linguistica* [it];
* *linguística* [pt].

And yes, I'm *partial* [en] to the Spanish word, because it has all those cool accents. And it's not even an [hyperforeignism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforeignism)!

## Format

The usual format will most likely be akin to a "word of the day" style daily posting. But it will more likely be a *concept* of the day: what's most fascinating about language differences is the existence of words for a given abstract concept in one language, but not another.

## Conventions

I shall write the language of particular words using their [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), e.g. : *lingüística* [es], *linguistica* [la]. Even when writing English words, I'll use this format to annotate all language specific word-concepts (words, expressions, concepts, whose translation might not be straightforward), such as *course of action* [en].

Later, I might use this annotation to allow searching the blog by language and by word-concept-expression.
