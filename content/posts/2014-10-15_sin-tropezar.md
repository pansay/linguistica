Sin tropezar
===

We've seen that the Italians are [unambiguously against](minestra-riscaldata-trombamici) reviving past relationships. What about Spanish, the other big language of romance?

Well...

*Donde hubo fuego, cenizas quedan* [es], is used specifically to justify getting back with an ex.

On the other hand, that doesn't mean you should *tropezar dos veces con la misma piedra* [es] (*make the same mistake twice* [en]).

Also, beware of *calientapollas* [es] (*cockteases* [en]) and try not to have to *casarse de penalty* [es] (*[shotgun wedding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_wedding)* [en]): you don't want your kids to *[nacer de penalty](http://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/penalti)* [es] (*be born as the cause and consequence of a shotgun wedding* [en]).

Instead you better *soler* [es] *balconear* [es]: *get in the habit of usually* [en] *talking at the balcony to your lover* [en].
