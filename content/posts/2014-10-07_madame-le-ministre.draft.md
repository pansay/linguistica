cet homme est une personne sympathique
cette femme est un thon

I wonder, is there even *one* case of a feminine word having a proposed "masculinization"? Didn't think so.


recrue
star
dupe
racaille



mannequin
top model
ange
thon

It’s worth remembering, too, that language change does not always come from a conservative – or a European – perspective. It was the Québécois who pioneered the feminization of job titles (with “new” versions such as professeure and ingénieure) in the 1970s. Two decades later, the Institut National de la Langue française in France issued a statement giving its citizens carte blanche to choose between this “Canadian” approach and the “double-gender” practice (allowing la professeur for a female teacher, for example). While the Académie française maintain that such “arbitrary feminization” is destroying the internal logic of the language, research among French speakers shows that the “double-gender” approach is gaining in popularity, but also that where there was once clarity, there is now uncertainty over usage.

The French Academy (L’Académie française [fr]) was founded by the Cardinal Richelieu (the bad guy from the Three Musketeers), and they're called the Immortals (like the bad guys from 300). The members have been chosen by *cooptation* ever since. Legally, the institution is a Foundation with particular rules, but it doesn't seem to be getting much financing from the French government

They're pretty harmless.
