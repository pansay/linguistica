Where I Stand
===


1. English is the universal present and future language of mankind
...
2. Anti-progress enemies of that cause include

* What I shall henceforth refer to as *babelists* [en], those who consider that the multiplication of languages and their preservation is not a punishement for sin, but a blessing
* consctructivists, who think they can just create a language out of the blue, like esperanto, forgetting the natural evolution of languages, arising as answers to specific conceptual *needs*.
