We told you to [learn Hebrew](hebrew), didn't we? Oh yes we did. To wit: [#9 there](hebrew).

Now check this [piece of news](https://pjmedia.com/culture/tyler-o-neil/2021/01/03/not-the-onion-democrat-ends-prayer-with-amen-and-a-woman-n1301818).

[In fact](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amen#Etymology), it's Hebrew through Latin, through Greek (notice how the commentators stop at the Latin, the poor devils):

> From Middle English amen, from Old English, from Ecclesiastical Latin āmēn, from Ancient Greek ἀμήν (amḗn), from Biblical Hebrew אָמֵן‎ (ʾāmēn, “certainly, truly”)

Now, as we've been saying: these are three languages you should know, of course. So that's not just one, but *three* layers of inexcusability for that moron, merely from a linguistic point of view, since having even a cursory knowledge of either three of them should have tipped him off. Of course, one might add a few political ones on top of that, but that's beyond our scope here.
