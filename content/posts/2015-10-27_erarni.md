*erární* [cs], of course from German *[ärarisch](http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/aerarisch)* [de], from the noun *[Ärar](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%84rar)* [de], from Latin *aerarium* [la]: military-issued, government-issued (the famous [G.I.](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._(military)>) !), and by extension, employer-issued, public, collective, provided-free-of-service, available-on-the-spot-to-be-shared, etc. Spanish [kept](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerarium) *erario* [es] in the original sense of *aerarium* [la]: public treasury.

*[fasovat](https://cs.wiktionary.org/wiki/fasovat), vyfasovat* [cs] = to get issued something, to obtain government issue objects. But what if you need to say "obtain, from a collective institution (army, government, hospital, etc), more of the goods usually provided by that institution?" Then of course, you'll say *[dofasovat](https://www.google.ch/webhp?q=dofasovat#safe=off&q=dofasovat)* [cs].
