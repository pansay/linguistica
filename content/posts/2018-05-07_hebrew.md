8 Hebrew words you already know
===

1. מָשִׁיחַ : *messiah* [en], which you know thanks to our old buddy [Jošua Pomazaný ](jesus/)(sorry, the Czech translation of [the world's favorite Jewish heretic's name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWOrJDqmduw) beats the Greek one).

2. כֶּלֶב : *clebs* [fr] or *clébard* [fr], that is: *dog* [en] -- which, on the other hand, is a false friend with דָּג, *fish* [en]. Tastes similar I guess, but remember that like סוּס it's not כָּשֵׁר.

3. [פעמיים נקודתיים](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.paamayim-nekudotayim.php): *double colon* [en] or *Scope Resolution Operator* [en]. Yes, if you're one of those [useless idiots](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/may/08/stephen-hawking-hypocrisy-israel-boycott) who want to boycott ~~Jewish~~ Israeli products, [hiding your antisemitic hatred under new names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydkiTlw9ATw), then start by not posting the boycott calls on facebook, [which runs on PHP](https://www.facebook.com/notes/jesus-is-coming-soon/so-you-want-to-boycott-israel-heres-a-list-of-products-and-services-you-need-to-/820698877940154/). You might also ponder how much easier it would be to boycott the products of all the combined enemies of אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל‬ , and what it says about *why* exactly they hate it so much, and why that makes that [the worst type of evil](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/envy-hatred_of_the_good_for_being_the_good.html).

4. בָּבֶל : *Babel* [en], whence *babelist* [en] ([introduced by](who-rules-over-french-language/) *un servidor* [es]), what we've been denouncing relentlessly here.

5. שֵׁכָר : liquor, but ended up as *cider* [en].

6. גָּמָל : *camel* [en].

7. אַבָּא : father, the first Hebrew word you learn when learning the hebrew abjad. Ended up as *[abbé](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abb%C3%A9#Etymology_2)* [fr], which is sort of a monk so you can call him father.

8. אָמֵן: *amen* [en]
