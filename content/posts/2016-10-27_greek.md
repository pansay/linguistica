Greek: 10 reasons to love Greek
===

1. [Λένα Πλάτωνος](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIoYrkzTQoE).
1. [The Wire's The Greek](http://linguistica.rocks/the-wire-for-polyglots/).
1. Learning Greek alphabet is a [prerequisite](learning-russian) for Russian alphabet.
1. You probably know a few letters already: π,λ,ρ,δ,α,β, at least.
1. Understanding Greek pronunciation of β and θ will help you grok Spanish and Russian pronunciation of b/v/β/в. How do you pronounce Barcelona? βarθelona. Now you know.
1. [Great course for Greek available](http://www.languagetransfer.org/complete-greek).
1. All the cool kids ([Mises](https://books.google.ch/books?id=BRABCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT8&lpg=PT8&dq=%22The+problem+which+here+confronts+us+is+the+socialization+of+ownership+in+the+means+of+production%22&source=bl&ots=Gabe22Xx3O&sig=dGuiLnBTsOfH03MMggEw6IwFX8w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEhIKQzvrPAhXhDpoKHe7vBMcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22The%20problem%20which%20here%20confronts%20us%20is%20the%20socialization%20of%20ownership%20in%20the%20means%20of%20production%22&f=false), Schopenhauer...) use Greek in their books, and they won't translate it for you, because it would be insulting to assume you don't know Greek.
1. Suddenly lots of words in all languages will make sense to you:
   * Thanks in Greek is *ευχαριστώ* [el]. Think of *eucharistie* [fr]
   * What's an atom? Something you can't divide, same as an individual. *άτομο* [el] is simply Greek for *individual* [en], which is just the latin version, *individuus* [la], both following the same composition of *a-* and *in-* for *not* divisible. You've seen those *a-* and *in-* everywhere, too. Think *anarchy* [en], or *incest* [en]...
   * *γαλα* [el], *milk* [en], think of *galaxy* [en], from Greek *γαλαξίας* [el], *Milky Way* [en]...
   * *megalopolis* [en] is just Greek for "big city". You know of course *μέγας* [el] from the [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) and *πόλις* [el] from *politics* [en], to be confused with *πολύς* [el], *many* [en] as in “Politics, n: Poly "many" + tics "blood-sucking parasites"”.
    * *εσπέρα* [el] is *evening* [en], same as *[vespéral](http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/vesp%C3%A9ral_vesp%C3%A9rale_vesp%C3%A9raux/81718)* [fr]
    * *catastrophe* [en] is of course *καταστροφή* [el], hence *catacomb* [en] is *κατά* [el] + *τύμβα* [el]
    * *apology* [en] from *απολογία* [el]
    * *ophtalmology* [en] and *odontology* [en]? [You guessed it](https://translate.google.com/#el/en/%CE%9F%CF%86%CE%B8%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BC%CF%8C%20%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AF%20%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B8%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%8D%20%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9%20%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B1%20%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AF%20%CE%BF%CE%B4%CF%8C%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82).
    * Hell even slavig languages [share roots](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/piti) with Greek: *πίνω* [el], пить [ru], *piť* [sk], etc.
1. conversely, Greek uses some [funny loan-words from French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallicisme ):
 * *γκαρσóνι* [el]
 * *καλτσόν* [el]
 * *κραγιόν* [el]
 * *κρουασάν* [el]
 * *σουτιέν* [el]
 * *φερμουάρ* [el]
 * and also *ασανσέρ* [el], *ascenseur* [fr], *elevator* [en]
1. Greek's capitalization rules are so fun [Internet Explorer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform) can't handle them.
