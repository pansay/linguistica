Who rules over French language?
===

Unlike English, French is a centralized language. And unlike English again, its aficionados [es] usually have autistic reactions when it comes to integrating words from other languages. The result is a much poorer language, torn between common, natural use, and artifical esperanto-like madness imposed by officials, academics and pressure groups. Who's to blame? By increasing order of guilt, *j'accuse* [fr]...

## The Immortals

http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/

The French Academy (L’Académie française [fr]) was founded by the Cardinal Richelieu (the bad guy from the Three Musketeers), and they're called the Immortals (like the bad guys from 300). The members have been chosen by *cooptation* ever since. Legally, the institution is a Foundation with particular rules, but it doesn't seem to be [getting much financing from the French government](http://www.europe1.fr/economie/academie-francaise-etre-immortel-combien-ca-coute-1993131), and they have no [actual legal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_France#Acad.C3.A9mie_fran.C3.A7aise)

Thus, they're pretty harmless. Sometimes they're right, sometimes not. Their main concern, though, appears to be a genuine care for the purity of the language. Somehow, that seems to require the purchase of ugly green jackets and extremely expensive swords. Yes.

### The International Organisation of La Francophonie ([en], sic)

With an 80 million euro budget financed by governments, their aim seems to be the promotion of some vague idea of French speakers helping others French speakers. I don't get it, and I don't like them.

## The French government

><p>And <i>académiciens</i> are not alone in their attempts to halt the sabotage of the French language: other authorities, with considerably more legal power, are hard at work too. The French government has introduced various pieces of legislation over the past forty years, the most far-reaching being the 1994 <a href="http://www.humanities360.com/index.php/toubon-law-and-the-languages-of-france-1649/">Toubon Law</a> which ruled that the French language must be used – although not necessarily exclusively – in a range of everyday contexts. Two years later, the French ministry of culture and communication established the <a href="http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/">Commission générale de terminologie et de néologie</a>, whose members, supervised by representatives from the Académie, are tasked with creating hundreds of new French words every year (such as <i>resserrement de credit*</i> and <i>poule finale*</i>) to combat the insidious and irresistible onslaught of Anglo-Saxon terminology. French speakers point out that in practice, most of these creations are not well-known and, if they ever leap off the administrative pages of the <a href="http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/">Journal officiel</a>, rarely survive in the wild. There are, however, a few notable exceptions, such as <a title="Logiciel" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/french-english/logiciel">logiciel</a> and – to an extent – <a title="Courriel" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/french-english/courriel">courriel</a>, which have caught on: the English takeover is not quite yet a <a title="Fait accompli" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fait-accompli">fait accompli</a>.</p>

This is already more about jacobinisme [fr] (the central power of Paris over France, crushing local dialects and cultures), than about mere linguistic concerns. And of course, it's about an autistic xenophobic inferiority complex of being scared of "foreign" words, substituting new word-concepts from English by new word-concepts made up.

>Mais pour éviter que, dans certains domaines, les professionnels ne soient obligés de recourir massivement à l’utilisation de termes étrangers, l’adaptation du vocabulaire doit être encouragée, facilitée et coordonnée. C’est pourquoi, depuis plus de trente ans, les pouvoirs publics incitent à la création, à la diffusion et à l’emploi de termes français nouveaux. Œuvrer à l’élaboration d’une terminologie de référence, conforme aux règles de formation des mots de notre langue, et la mettre à la disposition des professionnels et du public, telles sont les missions du dispositif d’enrichissement de la langue française mis en place par le décret du 3 juillet 1996.

Let me translate that for you: *In order to avoid that people who know what they're talking about use relevant and precise words, spontaneously adopted by them and then the general population, we shall use your tax money in order to foster bunches of bureaucrats. Those bureaucrats will create artificial words that, supposedly, "sound" more French. The new words will usually mostly sound uglier rather then Frenchier. The only objective difference that makes them more French is that only the French will use them. Assuming they do. That is, assuming we somehow coerce them into it or pressure them or subsdizize it. That is all.*

Why esperanto is a bad idea, and the French Academy's job is destructive: languages must evolve naturally.

## The Quebec government

Now those are really the guys with issues.
