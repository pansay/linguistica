Who rules over French language?
===

Unlike English, French is a centralized language. And unlike English again, its aficionados [es] usually have autistic reactions when it comes to integrating words from other languages. The result is a much poorer language, torn between common, natural use, and artifical esperanto-like madness imposed by officials, academics and pressure groups. Who's to blame? By increasing order of guilt, *j'accuse* [fr]...

## The Immortals

The French Academy (L’Académie française [fr]) was founded by the Cardinal Richelieu (the bad guy from the Three Musketeers), and they're called the Immortals (like the bad guys from 300). The members have been chosen by *cooptation* ever since. Legally, the institution is a Foundation with particular rules, but it doesn't seem to be [getting much financing from the French government](http://www.europe1.fr/economie/academie-francaise-etre-immortel-combien-ca-coute-1993131), and they have no [actual legal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_France#Acad.C3.A9mie_fran.C3.A7aise)

Thus, they're pretty harmless. Sometimes they're right, sometimes not. Their main concern, though, appears to be a genuine care for the purity of the language. Somehow, that seems to require the purchase of ugly green jackets and extremely expensive swords. Yes.

### The International Organisation of La Francophonie ([en], sic)

With an 80 million euro budget financed by governments, their aim seems to be the promotion of some vague idea of French speakers helping others French speakers. I don't get it, and I don't like them.

## The French government

This is already more about jacobin [fr] power of Paris than language.

## The Quebec government

Now those are really the guys with issues.
