Who rules over French language?

## The Immortals

The French Academy (L’Académie française [fr]) was founded by the Cardinal Richelieu (the bad guy from the Three Musketeers), and they're called the Immortals (like the bad guys from 300). The members have been chosen by *cooptation* ever since. Legally, the institution is a Foundation with particular rules, but it doesn't seem to be getting much financing from the French government

No legal power

They're pretty harmless. Sometimes they're right, sometimes not. Their main concern is a genuine care for the purity of the language.

### The International Organisation of La Francophonie [en] (sic)

Them, I don't like.

## The French government

This is already more about jacobin [fr] power of Paris than language.

## The Quebec government

Now those are really the guys with issues.
