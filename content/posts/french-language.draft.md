Who rules over French language?
===

Unlike English, French is a centralized language. And unlike English again, its aficionados [es] usually have autistic reactions when it comes to integrating words from other languages. The result is a much poorer language, torn between common, natural use, and artifical esperanto-like madness imposed by officials, academics and pressure groups. Who's to blame? By increasing order of guilt, *j'accuse* [fr]...

## The Immortals

The French Academy (L’Académie française [fr]) was founded by the Cardinal Richelieu (the bad guy from the Three Musketeers), and they're called the Immortals (like the bad guys from 300). The members have been chosen by *cooptation* ever since. Legally, the institution is a Foundation with particular rules, but it doesn't seem to be [getting much financing from the French government](http://www.europe1.fr/economie/academie-francaise-etre-immortel-combien-ca-coute-1993131), and they have no [actual legal power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_France#Acad.C3.A9mie_fran.C3.A7aise)

Thus, they're pretty harmless. Sometimes they're right, sometimes not. Their main concern, though, appears to be a genuine care for the purity of the language. Somehow, that seems to require the purchase of ugly green jackets and extremely expensive swords. Yes.

### The International Organisation of La Francophonie ([en], sic)

With an 80 million euro budget financed by governments, their aim seems to be the promotion of some vague idea of French speakers helping others French speakers. I don't get it, and I don't like them.

## The French government


><p>And <i>académiciens</i> are not alone in their attempts to halt the sabotage of the French language: other authorities, with considerably more legal power, are hard at work too. The French government has introduced various pieces of legislation over the past forty years, the most far-reaching being the 1994 <a href="http://www.humanities360.com/index.php/toubon-law-and-the-languages-of-france-1649/">Toubon Law</a> which ruled that the French language must be used – although not necessarily exclusively – in a range of everyday contexts. Two years later, the French ministry of culture and communication established the <a href="http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/dglf/">Commission générale de terminologie et de néologie</a>, whose members, supervised by representatives from the Académie, are tasked with creating hundreds of new French words every year (such as <i>resserrement de credit*</i> and <i>poule finale*</i>) to combat the insidious and irresistible onslaught of Anglo-Saxon terminology. French speakers point out that in practice, most of these creations are not well-known and, if they ever leap off the administrative pages of the <a href="http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/">Journal officiel</a>, rarely survive in the wild. There are, however, a few notable exceptions, such as <a title="Logiciel" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/french-english/logiciel">logiciel</a> and – to an extent – <a title="Courriel" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/french-english/courriel">courriel</a>, which have caught on: the English takeover is not quite yet a <a title="Fait accompli" href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fait-accompli">fait accompli</a>.</p>

This is already more about jacobinisme [fr] (the central power of Paris over France, crushing local dialects and cultures), than about mere linguistic concerns.

## The Quebec government

Now those are really the guys with issues.
