Minestra riscaldata e trombamici
===

Italian being the language of romance, of course it would have word-concepts to handle specific cases that can arise in this area. Thus, enter the saying *la minestra riscaldata non è mai buona* [it] apparently, from Venetian dialect, *la menestra riscaldada no la é mai bona*. A variant that made it all the way up to English speakers, though less known by true Italians, is *[cavoli riscaldati](http://www.thoughtfultravelwriter.com/2013/05/speaking-in-tongues-cavoli-riscaldati.html)* [it].

It means, *a reheated soup is never good* [en], that is, you should not try to revive past relationships. You can also use the short form *minestra riscaldata* [en] to refer to such revived relationships, or express it as a *caveat* [la] to a friend who would consider such a foolhardy venture.

Of course, for the same reasons, the Italians, God bless them, also gave us the beautiful *trombamici* [it] (*trombamico* [it], *trombamica* [it], *trombamici* [it], *trombamiche* [it]), which means, literally *fuck friends* [en], or, as I'd prefer in English, *sex buddies* [en].

If you ever go to Italy, you should be able to get along just fine by approaching women with a simple *vorresti essere una delle mie trombamiche?* [it], *would you like to be one of my fuck friends?* [en].

They even have the [Ten Golden Rules of the Perfect Fuck Friend](http://corrieredelsud.altervista.org/10-regole-doro-perfetto-trombamico-non-puoi-non-saperle/), and an explanatory table, included, I suppose, in every mid-school sex-ed textbook of Italy (click for hi-res version):

All you need to know is that *farlo* [it] means *do it* [en].

I should also mention that the Italian former Prime Minister,  *Il Cavaliere*, one of the most powerful men *urbis et [orbis]((http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/20/power-09_Silvio-Berlusconi_9SKC.html)* [la], considered renaming his political party to  *[Forza Gnocca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-hJzzlMKMM)* [it], which translates as *[Go Pussy](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/07/berlusconi-go-pussy-quip-outrage)* [en].

*[Silvio il grande](http://www.corriere.it/politica/13_luglio_01/manifestazione-arcore-sostegno-berlusconi-Pdl_a9f114f6-e26f-11e2-b962-140e725dd45c.shtml)* [it] (*Silvio the Great* [en]) is also known for having gotten himself into a scandal for [having sex with a minor prostitute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi_prostitute_trial), which, of course, *sports* [en] the beautiful name of *Ruby Rubacuori* [it], *Ruby the Heartstealer* [en].

As the French would say: *ça ne s'invente pas* [fr] &ndash; *you can't make this shit up* [en].
