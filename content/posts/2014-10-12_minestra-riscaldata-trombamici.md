Minestra riscaldata i trombamici
===

Italian being the language of romance, of course it would have word-concepts to handle specific cases that can arise in this area. Thus, enter the saying *la minestra riscaldata non è mai buona* [it] apparently, from Venetian dialect, *la menestra riscaldada no la é mai bona*. A variant that made it all the way up to English speakers, though less known by true Italians, is *[cavoli riscaldati](http://www.thoughtfultravelwriter.com/2013/05/speaking-in-tongues-cavoli-riscaldati.html)* [it].

It means, *a reheated soup is never good* [en], that is, you should not try to revive past relationships. You can also use the short form *minestra riscaldata* [en] to refer to such revived relationships, or express it as a *caveat* [la] to a friend who would consider such a foolhardy venture.

Of course, for the same reasons, the Italians, God bless them, also gave us the beautiful *trombamici* [it] (*trombamico* [it], *trombamica* [it], *trombamici* [it], *trombamiche* [it]), which means, literally *fuck friends* [en], or, as I'd prefer in English, *sex buddies* [en].

They even have the [Ten Golden Rules of the Perferct Fuck Friend](http://corrieredelsud.altervista.org/10-regole-doro-perfetto-trombamico-non-puoi-non-saperle/), and an explanatory table, included, I suppose, in every grammar textbook of Italy:

(All you need to know is that *farlo* [it] means *do it* [en].)
