Best said *while spitting*, or at least making the spitting gesture:

>“Pfui” (alternate spellings) is also a mild version of spitting. We all know how the expression is used, but probably not that it is also based on the same superstition to ward off evil. With the expression of disbelief, disdain, consternation at someone’s remark, we reject it, perhaps to subconsciously indicate that they are words we wouldn’t take in our own mouth, spitting them out. Unknowingly however, we are warding off the evil we infer in the remark.

>The expression “pfui” comes from Yiddish/German. The stronger German expression, “Pfui Teufel! (devil)” makes clear the connection to the superstition about spitting, as do those who repeat “pfui” three times for emphasis.
