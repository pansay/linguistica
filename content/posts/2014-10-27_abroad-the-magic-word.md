Abroad: the magic word
===

Hello, stranger.

## Strangers or strange lands

Heinlein - Stranger in a strange land (which gave us the beautiful word-concept *to grok* [en] : to drink, to understand completely)

the premise of the book being very similar to that of the French Voltaire - *L'Ingénu* (see also his other classic *Candide* - the two words have the exact same meaning as *naïve*, a third French word to say the same!)

The word *stranger* [en] has roots in old French, thus comes from the same Latin root (*extraneus* [la]) as *étranger* [fr], *straniero* [it], *extranjero* [es]. But since it has other meanings, if you wish to refer to *someone born in country A and living in country B*, you're more likely to use *foreigner* [en], *immigrant* [en], if you reside in country B, and *emigrant* [en], or *expatriate* [en] if you reside in country A.

It all loses much of its relevance if you try to involve countries C and more, of course. In the age of globalization, it all loses much of its relevance: today, you can be born in one country, have the citizenship of a third, pay your groceries in the money of a fourth, sell services on-line paid in the currency of a fifth, and, ideally, pay your taxes in a tax haven sixth country. So who's a foreigner, and who isn't? And what's a foreign language? And what could "foreign country" possibly mean? Hey, Americans, do you know you live in a foreign country according to most of the world?

Answer: everyone is someone's foreigner, and [there are no foreign languages](http://inner-game.info/how-to-learn-languages/).

It's like that old French hamster joke:

>Un hamster stupide se balade au bord d'une rivière. Tout à coup, il aperçoit son copain le hamster crétin sur l'autre rive. Il veut le rejoindre et l'appelle&nbsp;:
>
>-Eh&nbsp;! Hamster crétin, comment t'as fait pour passer de l'autre côté de la rivière&nbsp;?
>
>-Mais, imbécile&nbsp;! T'es déjà de l'autre côté&nbsp;!
>
>&nbsp;
>
>A stupid hamster is walking alongside a river. Suddenly, he notices his friend the moron hamster on the other bank of the river. He'd like to join him and so he calls out:
>
>-Hey, moron hamster! How did you manage to get on the other side of the river?
>
>-You idiot! You're already on the other side!

But the word-concepts tell us a lot about the history of the movement of people.

## Immigrants or emigrants

Australia, ah the irony,

Notice also the once common practice of deporting nationals - now only "foreigners".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate

 The differentiation found in common usage usually comes down to
socio-economic factors, so skilled professionals working in another
country are described as expatriates, whereas a manual labourer who
has moved to another country to earn more money might be labelled an
'immigrant'.

*заграница* [ru] ?

>Consciously or not, in the mind of any rebel in Soviet Russia, particularly of the young, there is only one court of final appeal against the injustice, the brutality, the sadistic horror of the inhuman social system in which they are trapped: *abroad*.
>
>The meaning of that word for a Soviet citizen is incommunicable to anyone who has not lived in that country: if you project what you would feel for a combination of Atlantis, the Promised Land and the most glorious civilization on another planet, as imagined by a benevolent kind of science fiction, you will have a pale approximation. “Abroad,” to a Soviet Russian, is as distant, shining and unattainable as these; yet to any Russian who lifts his head for a moment from the Soviet muck, the concept “abroad” is a psychological necessity, a lifeline and soul preserver.
>
>That concept is made of brilliant bits sneaked, smuggled or floating in through the dense gray fog of the country’s physical and spiritual barbed-wire walls: in foreign movies, magazines, radio broadcasts, or even the clothing and the confident posture of foreign visitors. These bits are so un-Soviet and so alive that they blend in one’s mind into a vision of freedom, abundance, unimaginable technological efficacy, inconceivable achievements and, above all, a sense of joyous, fearless, benevolent gaiety. And if European countries, in this vision, are shining planets, America is the sun.

*Abroad* is a magic word:

>All heads bent over the table, over a tiny, round, orange and gold box. Vava whispered the magic words: “From *abroad*.”
>
>They looked at it reverently, afraid to touch it. Vava whispered proudly, breathlessly, trying to sound casual: “Face powder. French. Real French. It’s smuggled from Riga. One of Father’s patients gave it to him—in part payment.”
