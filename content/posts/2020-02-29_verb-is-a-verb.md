Verb is a verb
===

Aaah, verbs. It is in verbs and conjugations that languages really reveal their richness. Today we'll focus on verbs of a particular type. In Latin they seem to be classified as "[semi-deponent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deponent_verb#Latin)":

> Additionally, four Latin verbs (audēre, to dare; gaudēre, to rejoice; solēre, to be accustomed; and fīdere, to trust) are called semi-deponent, because though they look passive in their perfect forms, they are semantically active in all forms.

Not sure if that is exactly what we're looking for, but close enough. What interests us here are verbs that express in one word (the conjuguated verb itself), in one language, what would take several words in another one.

Let's start with the *solēre* [la] example from above. It's very common in Spanish as *[soler](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/soler#Spanish)* [es] -- to usually do. Yet it [does exist](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/soleo#Descendants) in all Latin-derived languages, even in French there is *[souloir](https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/souloir)* [fr], although it's not in common use.

The good surprise though is its existence in [German](german-uber-alles): *[pflegen zu](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pflegen)* [de].

Speaking of German, it has the beautiful *stimmen* [de] -- to be true, as well as *[gelten](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gelten)* [de] -- to be valid.

Czech, on the other hand, has *[bodnout](https://ssjc.ujc.cas.cz/search.php?heslo=bodnouti&sti=4656&where=hesla)* [cs] -- to be useful, or even *[to hit the spot](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hit_the_spot)* [en], *stonat* [cs] to be sick (active), *ochořet* [cs] to get sick (passive). Regarding the latter: *enfermarse* [es], *ammalarsi* [it], *sich enkranken* [de]. Czech also has *stydět se* [cs] to be ashamed... How would you use the imperative with "to be ashamed" In English? "Be ashamed!"? Bah, no good. Also, *zout* [cs] -- to take somebody's shoes off. Indeed, how could a language not have a verb for that. But then again, Czech (and other Slavic languages like Russian), don't really have a common use separate word for foot/hand as opposed to leg/arm...
