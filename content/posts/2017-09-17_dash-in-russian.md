How do you say dash in Russian?
===

If you think typography doesn't matter, think about how much meaning can be contained in a simple dash.

Look carefully at the last line of [this table](https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/Приказ_НКВД_от_30.07.1937_№_00447#II._.D0.9E_.D0.9C.D0.95.D0.A0.D0.90.D0.A5_.D0.9D.D0.90.D0.9A.D0.90.D0.97.D0.90.D0.9D.D0.98.D0.AF_.D0.A0.D0.95.D0.9F.D0.A0.D0.95.D0.A1.D0.A1.D0.98.D0.A0.D0.A3.D0.95.D0.9C.D0.AB.D0.9C_.D0.98_.D0.9A.D0.9E.D0.9B.D0.98.D0.A7.D0.95.D0.A1.D0.A2.D0.92.D0.95_.D0.9F.D0.9E.D0.94.D0.9B.D0.95.D0.96.D0.90.D0.A9.D0.98.D0.A5_.D0.A0.D0.95.D0.9F.D0.A0.D0.95.D0.A1.D0.A1.D0.98.D0.98.). What do you think the dash in the second column cell means?

Each line is an administrative region of the Soviet Union. The two grouped sections are regions of Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

The last line is a little different. Лагеря НКВД [ru]. What could it mean? Well let's see what the table is about. It's an executive order of quotas of people to either execute (first column) or send to the Лагеря НКВД [ru] (second column). The third column is the total.

The order is signed by Николай Иванович Ежов, the chief of that same НКВД, under orders from Иосиф Сталин.
