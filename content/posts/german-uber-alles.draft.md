German über alles
===

You can't mention German without doing some stupid nazi joke, like the title above. You can't think of German without remembering a language pushed down the throats of generations of people under the Austro-Hambourg empire, an official language of Switzerland pushed to its students of non-German-speaking regions with dumb school textbooks, and massacred in its various Swiss German dialects.

Yet, dig deeper. Forget all that, unlearn the crap, and [start anew](learning-languages). You have to go beyond all that, and discover a beautiful, subtle, rich and intuitive language. A language that gave us such beautiful concepts as

unwelt,zeitgeist,weltanschauung,dasein
dasein pobyt

the language of philosophy, the language of new composite words.

A language that has different good-byes:

auf Wiederhören
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/auf_Wiederh%C3%B6ren

auf wiederschreiben

you can even push the idea further, and if you happen to have some German *[trombamica](trombamici)* [it],

and need to *despedirse* [es] (say good-bye), what more appropriate than a *auf wiederficken* [de] ?

Spanish: hasta la vista (which has become quite ruined even in Spanish by its infamouse use by an actor with a German accent)... in French, mind using au revoir
Hasta la oída ?
