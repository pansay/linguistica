German über alles
===

You can't mention German without a perfunctory nazi reference, like the title above. You can't think of German without remembering a language pushed down the throats of generations of people under the  Austro-Hungarian Empire, an official language of Switzerland pushed to its students of non-German-speaking regions as mandatory with dumb school textbooks, and massacred in its various Swiss German dialects.

Yet, dig deeper. Forget all that, ignore the [jealousy](http://9gag.com/gag/aBRqZ4x?ref=fb.s) of *vulgar* latin languages, unlearn the crap, and [start anew](learning-languages). You have to go beyond all that, and discover a beautiful, subtle, rich and intuitive language. A language that gave us such beautiful concepts as

unwelt,zeitgeist,weltanschauung,dasein
dasein pobyt

the [language of philosophy](http://www.slate.fr/tribune/84783/la-traduction-assassine-dheidegger), the language of [new composite words](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10095976/Germany-drops-its-longest-word-Rindfleischeti....html).

A language that has different good-byes:

auf Wiederhören
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/auf_Wiederh%C3%B6ren

auf wiederschreiben

you can even push the idea further, and if you happen to have some German *[trombamica](trombamici)* [it],

and need to *despedirse* [es] (say good-bye), what more appropriate than a *auf wiederficken* [de] ?

Spanish: hasta la vista (which has become quite ruined even in Spanish by its infamouse use by an actor with a German accent)... in French, mind using au revoir
Hasta la oída ?

*[Zwangswirtschaft](http://mises.org/midroad/mr5.asp)* [de] economic system based on coercion

*Zwangsgesellschaft* [de] a society based on coercion


*ab und zu* [de] (*de vez en cuando* [es] ?)
