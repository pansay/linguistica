German über alles
===

You can't mention German without doing some stupid nazi joke, like the title above. You can't think of German without remembering a language pushed down the throats of generations of people under the Austro-Hambourg empire, an official language of Switzerland pushed to its students of non-German-speaking regions with dumb school textbooks, and massacred in its various Swiss German dialects.

Yet, dig deeper. You have to go beyond all that, and discover a beautiful, subtle, rich and intuitive language. A language that gave us such beautiful concepts as

unwelt,zeitgeist,weltanschauung,dasein
dasein pobyt

the language of philosophy.

A language that has different good-byes:

auf wiederschreiben


Spanish: hasta la vista... in French, mind using au revoir
