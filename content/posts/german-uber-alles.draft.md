German über alles
===

You can't mention German without a perfunctory [nazi reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschlandlied#Use_during_Nazi_rule). You can't think of German without remembering a language that symbolized foreign dominion over peoples under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, an official language of Switzerland pushed down the throats of its students of non-German-speaking regions as mandatory with dumb school textbooks, and massacred in its various Swiss German dialects.

Yet, dig deeper. Forget all that, ignore the [jealousy](http://9gag.com/gag/aBRqZ4x?ref=fb.s) of *vulgar* latin languages, unlearn the crap, and [start anew](http://inner-game.info/how-to-learn-languages/). You have to go beyond all that, and discover a beautiful, subtle, rich and intuitive language. 

The [language of philosophy](http://www.slate.fr/tribune/84783/la-traduction-assassine-dheidegger), the language of [new composite words](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10095976/Germany-drops-its-longest-word-Rindfleischeti....html), the language that gave us such beautiful concepts as:

- *[Dasein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein)* [de] (*pobyt* [cs]) your *local and temporal existence*...
- *Umwelt* [de] ... in your given *subjective environment*...
- *Weltanschauung* [de] ... from which you draw your *world view*...
- *Zeitgeist* [de] ... influenced of course by the *intellectual atmosphere* of your time.

Of course, try not to live under either of these regimes:

- *[Zwangswirtschaft](http://mises.org/midroad/mr5.asp)* [de] economic system based on coercion;

- *Zwangsgesellschaft* [de] a society based on coercion.

A language that has different good-byes depending on the means of communication:

- *auf Wiedersehen* [de] (*au revoir* [fr], *arrivederci* [it], *hasta la vista* [es])
- [auf Wiederhören](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/auf_Wiederh%C3%B6ren) [de] (*hasta la oída* [es], *arriascoltarci* [it])
- *auf Wiederschreiben* [de] (*arrileggerci* [it])
- you can even push the idea further, and if you happen to have some German *[trombamica](trombamici)* [it], and need to *despedirse* [es], what more appropriate than an *auf Wiederficken* [de]?
