We've seen that the Italians are [unambiguously against]() reviving past relationships. What about Spanish, the other big language of romance?

Well...

*donde hubo fuego, cenizas quedan* [es], is used specifically to justify reviving a previous relationship.

On the other hand, that doesn't mean you should *tropezar dos veces con la misma piedra* [es].

Also, beware of *calientapollas* [es], and try not to have to *casarse de penalty* [es]
