Thus spake The Immortals. I think that's clear... But remember [who rules over French language](french-language): they have no legal authority, the French parliament has.

Beyond politics, why are the Immortals right?

Because French is a language with grammatical genders, and they're unrelated to biological gender of persons. Like for the German Mädchen [de], which is gramatically neuter, although it can designate exclusively biologically female persons.

A few all-too-quickly forgotten examples will make this a lot clearer:

* personne [fr]: person [en], feminine word. When you need to talk about a male person, you write *cet homme est une personne sympathique* [fr].
* 
cette femme est un thon

I wonder, is there even *one* case of a feminine word having a proposed "masculinization"? Didn't think so.


recrue
star
dupe
racaille



mannequin

It’s worth remembering, too, that language change does not always come from a conservative – or a European – perspective. It was the Québécois who pioneered the feminization of job titles (with “new” versions such as professeure and ingénieure) in the 1970s. Two decades later, the Institut National de la Langue française in France issued a statement giving its citizens carte blanche to choose between this “Canadian” approach and the “double-gender” practice (allowing la professeur for a female teacher, for example). While the Académie française maintain that such “arbitrary feminization” is destroying the internal logic of the language, research among French speakers shows that the “double-gender” approach is gaining in popularity, but also that where there was once clarity, there is now uncertainty over usage.
